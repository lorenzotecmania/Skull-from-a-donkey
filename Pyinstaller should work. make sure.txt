Pyinstaller should work. make sure you did it correctly. The right way is as follows:

windows key + r

type cmd

type pip install pyinstaller

close command prompt and open library

go to your project

highlight the path displayed at the top and change it to cmd

press enter; command prompt should open up

type pyinstaller --onefile -w [name of file].py

wait for it to finish

you can delete any newly made files and folders that weren't there originally

Make sure python is in your PATH. If this doesn't help, sorry I'm beat.
